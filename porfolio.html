          <h2>Define</h2>
          <p>At the beginning of the assessment, we did a lot of research on the possibility of automatic and the current delivery market status. It was true that automatic can be apply to different industry, but we still stuck with parcel delivery as we found that it has been an indivisible part of life. It would be a great opportunity if our concept incredibly merges with the industry.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Ideation</h2>
          <p>We picked parcel loss as a trouble that we were going to solve by the end of assessment. We started with storyboarding the situation when autonomous vehicles were applied and 3 scenarios were come out. </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <h3>Hand Sketch</h3>
              <p>It is a method that shows how our concept will be presented. The reason we used it is it was not time consuming and easy to alter the design. And we were able to jot down some changes right after doing user evaluation. </p>

            <li>
              <h3>Lowfi prototype</h3>
              <p>A low fidelity prototype was created based on the comment received from hand sketches. We used Sketch to make it like a real app. Every button, every layout was on scale. Although it was not clickible yet, it showed how will interfaces be linked and displayed on the phone.</p>
              <img src = 'pic/lf1.png' alt = 'first_Lowfi' style = " width:180px;  height:370px; ">
              <img src = 'pic/lf2.png' alt = 'second_Lowfi' style = " width:180px;  height:370px; ">
              <img src = 'pic/lf3.png' alt = 'third_Lowfi' style = " width:180px;  height:370px;">
            </li>
            <br>

            <li>
              <h3>Highfi prototype</h3>
              <p>From the three concepts we first drew out, we picked one to further develop. We extracted some important points after doing user evaluations, like addable features, unsatisfying detail, etc, and put/ correct them in the new design. </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>

          <h2>User evaluation</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <h3>Research goal</h3>
                <ol type = "i">
                  <li><b>How do users rate the idea</b></li>
                  <li><b>How easy understand is the interfaces</b></li>
                  <li><b>How is the flow when every pages is linked</b></li>
                  <li><b>What features should be added</b></li>
                </ol>
              </li>

              <li>
                <h3>Think aloud</h3>
                <p>The aim of applying think aloud is to collect the real-time response from the participants. As they are asked to speak out their thought when they are moving through our user interfaces, we can immediately jot down the parts that make them confused. After recording their feeling and reaction, we are able to do changes based on the collected response.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <h3>Interview</h3>
                <p>Interview gives us in-depth feedbacks on our interfaces. From the vision of target audience, they know what they want and how they expect to interact with the apps. Therefore, we can add the elements that we previously lack of and improve the overall user experience.</p>

            <h2>Refine</h2>

            <h3>Tryout our prototype!</h3>
            <p>This is our final prototype. It solves the problem by securing the parcel in a locked box. Only the recipient knows the passcode that is used to unlock the box. Besides, it is a door to door service that prevents the situation of parcel were put at a “safe place” where no one knows. </p>
            <p> This created on Invision and Sketch which is called AutoV. It includes all of the functions which customers are needed. We’ve got starting delivery, a list of parcels, no matter they are delivered or not delivered, and tracking functions which give information to the users about the orders’ location and estimated time of arrival. Besides, there are normally not only functional buttons in the apps, but also informative stuff should be included. Therefore, we have a list of prices, common questions asked by the user and “about our company” for the consumer to know more about us. To make users switching between major functions more conveniently, we put a navigation bar underneath. Users are able to tap and switch to another function at any stage anytime.</p>

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>I am appreciated that we finished all the tasked in the assessment. From the assessment, on top of anything, we were more familiar with the design process. It is an infinity improving loop that makes our prototype better. Other than that, each of us is able to lead the team on the area that one’s strong at, and assist others on the area that one’s weak in. It was a great opportunity to learn from other.</p>
