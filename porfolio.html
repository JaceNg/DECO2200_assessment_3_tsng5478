        <h1>Tryout our prototype!</h1>
        <p>This is an app prototype created on Invision and Sketch which is called AutoV. It includes all of the functions which customers are needed. We’ve got starting delivery, a list of parcels, no matter they are delivered or not delivered, and tracking functions which give information to the users about the orders’ location and estimated time of arrival. Besides, there are normally not only functional buttons in the apps, but also informative stuff should be included. Therefore, we have a list of prices, common questions asked by the user and “about our company” for the consumer to know more about us. To make users switching between major functions more conveniently, we put a navigation bar underneath. Users are able to tap and switch to another function at any stage anytime.
        </p>
        <p>AutoV is a futuristic delivery business which allows customers to customize their orders. To improve the quality of our service, we adapted autonomous technologies into our business. There are various benefits that they can bring to us. First, we can provide faster service thanks to replacing human courier with autonomous drone. Our couriers will not be affected by the road condition as they are flying up high. Next, we have more accurate delivery which means customers can minimize the arrival time range of the drone. Majorly, we are doing one delivery per one journey. As a result, the delay caused by waiting other customers can be significantly reduced. Last but not least, we provide real-time camera which allows no matter the customers or our staff to keep track on their parcel.
