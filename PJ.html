          <h1>Week 3</h1>
          <h2>16/8-23/8</h2>
        </div>
        <p>This was the first week I start recording my progress. Our group was working a common topic, parcel delivery. After came up with this topic, I did a lot of research on it. I, first, found that a lot of delivery companies have been working on autonomous vehicle. Although it is a trend to develop autonomy to replace human operation, there must be some weaknesses that they want to overcome by using autonomous vehicles. That is the reason they spent a lot to this industry. Besides, I also did some research on autonomy industry, like when was the concept first proposed and how is it doing currently.

          <h1>Week 4</h1>
          <h2>23/8-30/8</h2>
        </div>
        <p>This was a busy week. I had to collect different data in order to find out how people think of the delivery industry. I did interviews and questionnaires on their past experience and their thought. I found that most of them had at least one bad experience when they were waiting for their parcel. Some met a courier with negative attitude, some lost their parcel and some received a damaged parcel. Based on the finding on the data collections, I grouped them into an affinity diagram which made the whole analysis process clearer. After those process, I created 2 personas which are presenting the key finding of my affinity diagram. Last, I drew two storyboards to express how is the delivery nowadays.

          <h1>Week 5</h1>
          <h2>30/8-6/9</h2>
        </div>
        <p>In this week, our group had some discussion on the assignment after lesson. We were actually so confused about the word “concept” for our storyboard. Therefore, we asked Christina for some helps. She went through the whole outline with us and explained the concept of “concept” to us. She gave us an example about remote communication. In the past, people couldn’t contact their family or friends when they were overseas, so the problem they have to solve is to find a way to connect between two locations. Therefore, we have texting, video call and audio call nowadays. After asking Christina, we sat back and planned what should we do in this week. By the next week, we decided to finish the storyboard, 1 or 2 storyboards for each of us and picked the best two for our assessment. However, the result/ feedback of assessment 1 had not yet given back to our group due to the tutor switch. There might be a little delay on that. So, we, first, wrote out our finding based on the research and affinity diagram. Then, we classified them into group by their common characteristics. And finally, we chose to prevent parcel loss as the problem we are going to solve throughout this semester. I spent 2 days to think of and draft the methods that can be drawn on the storyboard, then I drew my storyboard on Saturday. After I finished the storyboard, I asked my groupmate about their progress, and they were actually doing good as well. We each did one storyboard. We decided to wait until the next studio and discuss what we should do in the next step.

          <h1>Week 6</h1>
          <h2>6/9 – 13/9</h2>
        </div>
        <p>From this week on, we shared our concept to each other and had some discussion on our storyboard. In total, we have got 3 storyboards. We gave out feedback and pinpoint on the concept. However, we were not using the same storyboard template and that would be a bit not clear to present. So, we found one storyboard template online and used it as a common base. After that, we decided to work on the hand sketched wireframe this week. After having our unique wireframe, our concept can be further explained as the wireframe is a way to show the flow of the concept. If possible, we are going to start the low fidelity wireframe as well. After our studio, I tried to do some wireframes sketching. I imagined how would the users use my app and did 8 pages of interface. I’ve got a login page which users could assess to their personal account, or they could track a specific parcel by inputting a tracking number. There are 3 main features in the account. They are “delivery”, “notification” and “contact”. In the delivery page, there is a list of not yet delivered parcels that were held by the delivery company. By tapping the item on the list, users are able to get the up to date progress of the parcel like where is the parcel, or how long would it take to reach the destination. In the notification page, the system sends time options to the users when the parcel is ready. Users can choose the favorable time slot for receiving parcels. Last, the contact page allows the users to provide some feedbacks and complements in order to improve our service. Also, any complaints can be reflected in that page. That’s pretty much of my sketches. Before the next week studio, I put part of my sketches into mac and transform them into low fidelity wireframe. They are similar, I just did some minor alter in the low fidelity wireframe and put some color on it.

          <h1>Week 7</h1>
          <h2>13/9-20/9</h2>
        </div>
        <p>In the studio, I continue on my low fidelity mockup. While it was finished, Christina came to our group and asked how was our progress. Then, we told her that we were now doing digital mockup and ready to do user evaluation in the next week. Then she asked us to show and tell her our storyboards. However, she said our concept was not distinct enough. We are like working on some feature inside the apps rather than a solution to the problem. The features we thought is existing and has been applying even it is not on autonomous vehicles. At that time, we knew that we have to rethink our “concept” as the word “concept” in the design brief is too misleading. For the rest of the studio, we went back to the origins. We gathered our last concepts into a new one and worked on a new concept from different perspectives. I think it is much better than the previous one. Besides the storyboard, I drew an interface flow for my app. It includes two main streams, one is for placing an order one delivery and one is for tracking an order.

          <h1>Week 8</h1>
          <h2>20/9-27/9</h2>
        </div>
        <p>At the beginning of the studio, we spoke to our tutor, Christina. She was so appreciated that we got some brand new and good ideas. And we should keep working on those directions. After that, we gathered up and discussed the interface we should have. The basic pages that should be included are similar to the ones in my interface flow. So, I started to draw out some interfaces. Actually, as delivery parcel is now a mature, they are having standard process. Therefore, a lot of features or functions has been standardized. And that, I am able to do some minor changes on my past design and put them into the new concept. Same as my flow, there are two options in the homepage. They are ordering which allows users scheduling a drone directly to his house and tracking allows users to get up to date information of their parcel. In the ordering page, users have to select a suitable drone which fits the parcel size and weight. After selecting a drone, users will be directed to the payment page. There is the information of the order for reconfirmation in the same page. Last, a message of tracking number and unlock passcode will be sent to the users. On the other hand, there is a real-time map and estimated time of arrival in the tracking page which users can spare a time the pick up their parcel. Every drone is linked to a specified tracking number, and every tracking number is linked to an account. So, the users just need to simply enter the passcode in the app to unlock the box. the drone will be fly away after a certain of time or after the user press finish in the app. As we have no class next week, my group decided to meet up during the semester break.

          <h1>Week 9</h1>
          <h2>27/9-4/10</h2>
        </div>
        <p>I did a lot of user evaluations this week. I, first, conducted think aloud with 5 participants on my initial concept. I ask them to finish a task and say what is in their mind in every step. I record their thoughts and experiences for improvement during the evaluation. After doing think aloud, I did an interview on them right after the tryout my interfaces to ensure they still remember the experience. I got some nice result after the two evaluations for my improvement. Then, I start working on my low fidelity mockups. Basically, the low fidelity mockups and the same thing with the hand-sketches. I colored the low fidelity mockups and made it more visually appealed. Besides, I add a feature a profile feature that is previously not in the interfaces. After that, I took my low fidelity mockups to the participants who had attended the first round of evaluation. As I thought they were more understanding on my project, and they were more willing to see what and how I alter my design, they were the primary target on the second round of evaluation. And yes, they were all agreed to do that. Same as the first evaluation, I did think aloud and interview on them. They thought the low fidelity mockups are much better than the hand sketches. They were satisfied with the flow between interfaces. They were appreciated and said it had a great improvement on no matter the attraction or function, and they saw their feedback were really bring to the apps. Afterwards, they gave me more feedbacks on adding various functions such as “star a drone” and friend list. Their opinions were really helpful for us. I marked them up and keep them for some special feature on our chosen concept. I, then, put my concept and design to the report, analyzed the evaluation and extracted some important and useful comment and put everything to the report.

          <h1>Week 10</h1>
          <h2>4/10-11/10</h2>
        </div>
        <p>This is the final week before we present our concept. The last thing we left were finalizing the chosen concept, and design the interfaces for the final concept. We chose secure delivery as the final one because of 2 reasons. First, the key findings from assessment 1 revealed that the majority of losing parcel was because of the Courier.  It is true that Parcel Distribution and Direct Delivery reduce the risk of parcel loss during the transition between warehouses, but Secure delivery is a direct solution to the problem. Second, it is probably not realistic to apply Direct Delivery when the parcel is traveling a long way. The battery of drones and weather changes becomes a huge problem yet they are some kind of engineering problem. Precisely we would like to go for the solution which is most likely to achieve in the coming future. Then we divided the work into 3, one of us will be doing the ordering function, one of us was assigned to do the tracking function and one of us will be working on the home page and login page. I chose working on ordering function after discussion. To build a high fidelity mockups, I had to put a lot of image into the design making it as similar as the publishing version. Not only image, I’ve also made a variety of options for the apps. Like when the users want to select the first item then the second item, I had to create different scenario to achieve it. That was really a long journal and I spent a lot of time on it. After finished my own part, we changed them into the same style making it more consistent. We linked all the page together and try it by ourselves. We tested it by giving a task to others. It was just a think aloud session to debug of interfaces. And finally, we selected some pages and put them on the presentation slides.

          <h2>11/10 – 18/10</h2>
        </div>
        <p>As we did more than other groups on assessment 2, we start doing evaluations on our final prototype this week. We planned to interview 2 participants each and we will get 6 attendees at the end. We come up with the questions we should ask in the interview in the studio. Most of the questions were asking the interfaces like what can we improve. Then I went to find participant for the interview.  After the interviews, we started to build the companion website. It was like a website version of our assessment 2. We put our concept on it, key finding of the evaluations and how did we refine our concept etc. and yeah seems similar and definitely harder than you think. It is not just a report but also, we have to care a lot about our coding, same as our process journal. We spent a lot of time on it until the due date.
